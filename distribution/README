Distributions
--

The "distribution" directory currently contains all files that should end up
in a distribution of ignition, as well as a makefile that will create a nice
archive that can be used with the ignition Installer.

It has been made this complicated because there were supposed to be two other
distributions of ignition: a demo, and a "lite" version.

So before this mechanism is getting used in the future, it should be changed
so that all files are taken and build from the repository automatically.
